# End-to-end-heart-disease-classification
This project focuses on building a classification model to predict the probability of heart disease based on patient-specific features such as age, cholesterol level, resting blood pressure, and other clinical indicators. The model is trained and validated on a labeled dataset using supervised learning techniques.
